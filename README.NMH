From reverse engineering the build process, Jan 25, 2020, NMH.

make book   - builds HTML files in _build, changing only those it thinks must be changed.
make build  - does the some, overwrites everything

make serve  - copies _build over to _site, changing some files, adding new ones, deleteing ~ files, start server
make site   - does the same except doesn't start server
              dir trees seem identical except for timestamps in files and
	      _site/feed.xml and _feed/.nojekyll in the 'make site' tree
