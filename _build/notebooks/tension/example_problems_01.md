# Tension Members - Example Problems

Here are some solved example problems for tension members
and their connections.

## Basic Analysis

* **[T01: Net Areas of Plates with Staggered Holes](../../text/tension/T01/net-areas-01)**  (Traditional Solution, figures + math only)
* **[T01u: Net Areas of Plates with Staggered Holes](T01/net-areas-01u)** Notebook solution.
Mostly the same as T01, except slightly reworded and re-organized **and computes with units** 
using the Python '[pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/)' module.

## Intermediate Analysis

* **[T10: Lap Splice 1u](T10/lap-splice-01)**  Uses [units](https://pint.readthedocs.io/).
* **[T15: Angle, Bolted One Leg](T15/bolted-single-angle-01u)**  1 angle or (2 angles back-to-back) bolted through one leg. Uses [units](https://pint.readthedocs.io/).
* **[T20: W Bracing System](T20/W-brace-01)**
* **[T30: HSS Bracing System](T30/HSS-brace-01-v4)**
