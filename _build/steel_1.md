# Design of Structural Steel Components

## Traditional Presentations

* **[Tension Members](text/tension/tension)**
* Connections
* Axially Loaded Compression
* Bending
* Beam Columns

## Notebook Presentations (Optional)

The examples in this section are presented using [Jupyter Notebooks](http://www.jupyter.org).
This is a computer based-interactive workbook using the [Python](https://www.python.org) programming
language.  There will be no examples here that are not also available using
the more traditional presentations, above.  If you feel you are not able to easily
understand the examples in this section, you may safely ignore them.

The following is a work in progress and is very much an experiment.  Things may 
frequently change.

* **[Tension Members](notebooks/tension/tension)**
* Connections
* Axially Loaded Compression
* Bending
* Beam Columns

## If You Speak Geek

* **[Programming Style](notebooks/Programming-Style)**  A discussion of one of the aspects of
the Python programming style to be used in these notes.
