# Tension Members - Example Problems

Here are some solved example problems for tension members
and their connections.

## Basic Analysis

* **[T01: Net Areas of Plates with Staggered Holes](T01/net-areas-01)**  (Traditional Solution, figures + math only)
* **[T01i: Net Areas of Plates with Staggered Holes](T01/net-areas-01i)** Notebook solution. 
Active cells containing Python code that may be modified and re-executed.  Otherwise, same as the above.
* **[T01u: Net Areas of Plates with Staggered Holes](T01/net-areas-01i)** Notebook solution.
Mostly the same as T01i, except slightly reworded and re-organized **and computes with units** 
using the Python '[pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/)' module.

## Intermediate Analysis

* **[T10: Lap Splice 1](T10/lap-splice-01)**
* **[T15: Single Angle, Bolted One Leg](T15.prev/bolted-single-angle-01)** 
* **[T15u: Angle, Bolted One Leg](T15/bolted-single-angle-01u)** Same problem as T15 above, but simplified Python, cleaned up presentation, and uses units in the calculations.  Also handles 1 or 2 angles back-to-back.
* **[T20: W Bracing System](T20/W-brace-01)**
* **[T30: HSS Bracing System](T30/HSS-brace-01)**
