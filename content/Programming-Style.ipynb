    "## Programming Style\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is intended to teach 3rd year Civil Engineering students about the design\n",
    "of structural steel components.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not intended to teach Python programming, though it is hoped that eventally\n",
    "they will be able to make small modifications to any of the notebooks and see the effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is an attempt to show alternative Python programming styles, and to compare them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base documents from which the students are working will almost\n",
    "always use single character identifiers to refer to various physical quantities.  Therefore\n",
    "there will be a lot of overloading.  For example, _t_ is always a thickness, but context will\n",
    "tell what thickness it is referring to at any particular instant.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it important that the Python code mimic this as closely as is practical. \n",
    "But the important part is that the Python not get in the way of understanding the engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems are mostly to compute strengths of specialized physical objects made of structural steel.  These are the general characteristics:\n",
    "* The simplist problems will have 5 to 10 parameters (usually single numbers specifying a dimension\n",
    "of a part, or a material characteristics, or an option, etc.).  The most complex problems may have up to 30 or 40 or so parameters.\n",
    "* In the most complex problems, these parameters may be spread over 5 or 10 different physical parts and a couple of different materials.  Multiple parts could have dimensions that are \n",
    "typically referred to using the same name, for example _thickness_, and denoted using the same symbol, _t_.\n",
    "* Calculations involve fairly small amounts of logic to calculate a specific quantity. Usually that\n",
    "logic is easily expressible in no more than 5 lines of Python.\n",
    "* Simple problems may have 5 sets of these calculations; complex problems may have 30 or 40.\n",
    "* The notebook structure is ideal for this, with one calculation set per cell.\n",
    "* This is all to support what we call \"design\" - determining the proper sizes of an object\n",
    "for structural safety.  In all but the simplese cases, this is trial and error: choose a set\n",
    "of parameters, calculate a strength; if not right, change something and do it all over.\n",
    "* Mostly, the calculations are specified by very specific and precise rules and formulae that cover many common \n",
    "cases.  In our case, the document is the [CSA S16-14 Design of Steel Structures](https://www.scc.ca/en/standardsdb/standards/27714), supplemented with lecture material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will perform one typical set of calculations to determine tension strength\n",
    "with respect to a complete fracture of the cross-section (there are other failure modes).\n",
    "We will show a number of different ways of structuring the Python to do this, and\n",
    "discuss the relative merits of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My favorite is currently Alternative 4 - using the 'with' statement.**"
