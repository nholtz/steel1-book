    "\n",
    "Problems are mostly to compute strengths of specialized physical objects made of structural steel.  \n",
    "These are the general characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The most simple problems will have 5 to 10 parameters (usually single numbers specifying a dimension\n",
    "  of a part, or a material characteristic, or a force, or an option, etc.).  The most complex problems \n",
    "  may have up to 30 or 40 or so parameters.\n",
    "* In the most complex problems, these parameters may be spread over 5 or 10 different physical parts \n",
    "  and a couple of different materials.  Multiple parts could have dimensions that are  typically \n",
    "  referred to using the same name, for example _thickness_, and denoted using the same symbol, _t_.\n",
    "* Calculations involve fairly small amounts of logic to calculate each specific quantity. Usually that\n",
    "  logic is easily expressible in only a few lines of Python.\n",
    "* Simple problems may have 5 sets of these calculations; complex problems may have 30 or 40.\n",
    "* The notebook structure is ideal for this, with one calculation set per cell and explanatory\n",
    "  material between.\n",
    "* This is all to support what we call \"design\" - determining the proper sizes of an object\n",
    "  for structural safety.  In all but the simplest cases, this is a trial and error process: \n",
    "  guess at a set of parameters, calculate a strength; if not adequate, change something and \n",
    "  do it all over.\n",
    "* Mostly, the calculations are specified by very specific and precise rules and formulae that \n",
    "  cover many common cases.  In our case, the document is the \n",
    "  [CSA S16-14 Design of Steel Structures](https://www.scc.ca/en/standardsdb/standards/27714), \n",
    "  supplemented with lecture material and other sets of information.\n",

    "Below we will perform one typical set of calculations to determine the tension strength\n",
    "with respect to a complete fracture of the cross-section (there are other failure modes).\n",
    "In the vocabulary of the profession, we are determining the '_Factored Tension Resistance_'\n",
    "of a bolted tension member\n",
    "\n",
    "We will show a number of different ways of structuring the Python to do this, and\n",
    "discuss the relative merits of each.\n",

    "```t1```, ```t2```, ```t3``` or ```t_angle```, ```t_gusset```, ```t_plate```, etc.\n",
