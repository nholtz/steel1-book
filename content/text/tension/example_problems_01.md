# Tension Members - Examples and Solved Problems

Here are some solved example problems for tension members
and their connections.

* **[T01: Net Areas of Plates with Staggered Holes](T01/net-areas-01)**.  (Traditional Solution, figures + math only)
* **[T03: Net Areas, Shear Lag, Welded Angle](T03/T3_weld-angle.pdf)**. Angle welded along 2 edges with balanced welds.
* **[T04: Net Areas, Shear Lag, Welded Plate](T04/T4_lap-welded-1.pdf)**.  Lap splice, welded, plates of unequal width.
* **[T05: Net Areas, Shear Lag, Welded HSS](T05/T5_hss-tension.pdf)**. Compute the tension resistance of an HSS with welded "tongue" connection.
* **[T07: Tension Resistance, Double Channels](T07/double-channel)**. Web-bolted channel, block shear.
* **[T08: Block Shear in Flat Plate](T08/block-shear-flat-plate)**. Compute block shear resistance of a single bolted flat plate.
* **[T09: Block Shear in Flange-Connected Tee Sections](T09/tee-block-shear.html)**. Patterns, 3D models, and area calculations.
* **[T10: Weld Balancing](T10/T10-weld-balance.pdf)**. Distribute required weld length on an angle 
so that the shear forces cause a minimal amount of bending.
